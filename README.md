# Bucks for Bites

This is a web application built during the [Greater Chicago Food Depository](http://www.chicagosfoodbank.org/) first [Hackathon to End Hunger](https://www.facebook.com/events/1793335117620404/).  

Bucks for Bites' principal goal is to promote participation among teenagers and older children in GCFD's programs.  It is common for older kids to bring their younger siblings to receive meals and yet not take a meal for themselves.  This is in large part due to the social stigma associated with receiving the help.

Bucks for Bites aims to provide an incentive to take part in the Greater Chicago Food Depository's meal programs by rewarding older kids and teenagers with online gift cards for sustained participation.  Inside of each meal package, a small card provides instructions on how to enroll and start collecting points.
