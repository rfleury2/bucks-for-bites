# Bucks for Bites

This is a web application built during the Greater Chicago Food Depository (ADD LINK) first Hackathon to End Hunger (ADD LINK).  Its principal goal is to promote participation among teenagers and older children in GCFD's programs.

It is common for older kids to bring their siblings to receive meals and themselves not participate due to the social stigma associated with receiving the help.  Bucks for Bites aims to provide an incentive for older kids to participate by awarding gift cards for sustained participation.
